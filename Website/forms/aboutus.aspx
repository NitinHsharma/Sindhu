            Post partition, like elsewhere in India, Sindhi community at Kota alsofocused its

energy to earn and feed their families on a priority. This led to setting up of small businesses at any available place and in any legitimate form. Small and petty business like grocery, stationery, fruits &amp; vegetables, general merchandise, tea stalls etc flourished all around. Educated persons with less business acumenship preferred Govt jobs in Railways, Post Office and other departments of the State and Central Governments.
        <br>
            <br>
            Sindhi Community in Kota believed in organized social behaviour and thus locality-wise Sindhi Panchayats, Sindhu Bhawans, Dharamshalas and Jhulelal Temples were by and by built. With passage of time and due to hard and sincere work, the community flourished and showed its presence .
        <br>
            <br>
            Having attained the economic goal, the community engaged itself for the promotion of Sindhi Culture, Literature, Language besides providing social and economic help to the poor and needy in the society.

        <br>
            <br>
            On 10 th of December, 1989 a progressive minded group of Sindhi community established an organisation namely SINDHU SOCIAL CIRCLE with Mr J.C.Bhatia as President and Mr Gopal Sapra as Founder Secretary. This organisation has since then been working for the benefit of the society as a whole, without any consideration of caste, creed and religion. It has a Female Wing also, with the name SINDHU MAHILA CIRCLE. These organisations set new benchmarks of quality in its all aspects and fields of activities like holding elections every year, changing the guards without fail and many Social Service Activities of very high standards.

        <br>
            <br>
            It was in the year 2013-14 that Mr Ashok Jhamtani the then President of Sindhu Social Circle endeavoured hard to connect with the educated and established Sindhi Youth of kota and succeeded in forming SINDHU YOUTH CIRCLE with Mr Jitendra Sadhwani as Founder President.
        <br>
            <br>
            In year 2013 we were bunch of few young Sindhi families, who felt there is need to know about more like minded families in Kota and unite thenm for a purpose. With this in mind we heartily acecpted the sponsorship of Sindhu Social Circle to form and organise SINDHU YOUTH CIRCLE.

        <br>
            <br>
            The Objectives, activities and profile of our Past Presidents, Office Bearers, and Members of our Organisation are mentioned elsewhere in detail.

        <br>
            <br>
            This website was originally used by Mr Lalit Alreja – the current President, to collect the information of Sindhi Families around. Now we use online and printed forms to gather this information.

        <br>
            <br>
            Originally Sindhu Youth Circle,Kota started with few sindhi families from Kota(Raj). Today we represent more than 100 families from Kota. We also hold elections every year and change the main Office Bearers. We have celebrated Four Cheti Chand functions which were very successful and worth witnessing. Our families also participated in celebrations at Cosmos Paradise &amp; Hiranandani Meadows.We continue to organise many more such fellowship programs to understand the aspirations of our Generation Next.

        <br>
            <br>
            Beside social activities SINDHU YOUTH CIRCLE is doing charitable works for our Sindhi Community. Financial help, text books, note books, grain, cloths, etc. are given to financially weaker people of our society. We ceaselessly work for the benefit of the society under the guidance of our parent organisation Sindhu Social Circle.
